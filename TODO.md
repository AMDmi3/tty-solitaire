# TODO
- signal handling
- turn either 1 or 3 cards to the waste pile (configurable)
- {cursor,label,hacker} mode (configurable)
- undo (?)

## For 1.0
- [ ] make compatible with non-colored terminals
- [ ] verify portability on different architectures
- [ ] handle screen resizing
- [x] number of passes through the stock (configurable)

## Ideas
- automatic moving of cards
- move without cursor (a digit for each stack)
- move like a hacker (e.g 'm03m2' == move 3 cards from maneuvre 0 to maneuvre 2)
